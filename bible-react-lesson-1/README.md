# React JS - Lesson 1
In this project I learned how to use React to create a simple web application.

### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

### Props
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

### State
State is used to store data that can change over time.

### ReactDOM
ReactDOM is a library that provides a render() method that will render a React component to the DOM.

### Input type change and radio
Input type change and radio are used to change the state of the component.

### Component lifecycle 
Component lifecycle is a series of methods that are called when a component is created, mounted, updated, and unmounted.

### Component tree
Component tree is a tree structure that represents the React component hierarchy.

### Component always with first letter capital

### UseEffect hook 
UseEffect hook is used to run code based on the state of a component.
Usually, use for fetching data from an API.

### File structure
1 coponent = 1 function.
In component, we can use state, props, lifecycle, and other React features.
